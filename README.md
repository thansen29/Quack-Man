# Background
Quack-man is a remake of the original Pac-Man, a game that hardly needs any introduction.

# Functionality & MVP
Quack-Man's aim is simple, collect the orbs to increase your points, and avoid the ghosts! Except when you eat a larger blinking orb, then you can eat the ghosts!
In this Quack-Man game, users will be able to:
- [ ] Start the game, toggle the sound
- [ ] Smoothly navigate the level
- [ ] Collect orbs while traversing over them, removing them from view
- [ ] Keep track of points, adding them to a total
- [ ] Die when touching a ghost, but eat the ghost after toggling their eatable attribute
- [ ] Complete a level, generating the next level
